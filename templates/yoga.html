            <p>The origins of yoga can be traced back over 5,000 years to northern India, where it was first mentioned in the ancient texts known as the Rig Veda. Initially, yoga was a spiritual practice aimed at self-realization. By the late 19th century, Indian monks began to share their knowledge of yoga with the West, leading to its widespread popularity in the 1970s as a form of physical exercise and holistic wellness.</p>
