        <h2>When to Use Music to Help</h2>
        <p>
          Music is said to enhance intelligence and focus, improve mental health, and boost the immune system as well as self-esteem and confidence. It can be used to relax, to boost and lift our mood, or to improve concentration. Music can also be used to aid in insomnia, helping to encourage and induce a deeper sleep. Many people have expressed how music is a form of ‘escape’ and can quickly and effectively transport them to a better time, place, or memory. Here are six benefits that music therapy can have on your mental health:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Improve Focus on Work or Study:</strong> There have been numerous studies proving that listening to classical music helps the mind to focus. Music with a tempo of 60 bpm (beats per minute) increases the brain’s ability to process information. There have also been studies suggesting that EDM (electronic dance music) helps sharpen focus while studying.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>As a Form of Expression:</strong> Music is a wonderful way of expressing emotion and creativity without having to say anything. Whether it’s playing a playlist of your favorite songs with friends or strumming your guitar, music is the perfect non-verbal way of expressing emotions that are too complex to talk about.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>To Lift the Mood:</strong> Playing uplifting songs has a profound effect on the brain, stimulating it to increase feel-good hormones which boost our mood.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>To Boost Confidence:</strong> Subliminal and ambient music such as binaural beat music is proven to assist in anxiety and low-confidence. Using alpha waves from 8-14 Hz help the mind get into a more sharpened and confident state of mind. Listening to binaural beat and isochronic tone music is ideal when you’re feeling nervous or fearful. It is believed that the brain syncs to the new frequency introduced by the binaural beat, altering your ‘brain state’ to a happier, more confident sense of being.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>To Relax:</strong> Meditative music has a cathartic effect on us, improving our mood and inducing relaxation of both the body and mind. Research has shown the calming sounds of piano, nature, and string instruments are very effective in helping you to relax.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>To Express Anger or Negative Emotion:</strong> Music is an incredible vehicle to help us process negative emotion. Listening to ‘angry’ music can be therapeutic when we’re dealing with stress and anger.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Affect of Music on Mental Health</h2>
        <p>Our brain can be divided into 4 parts - frontal lobe, temporal lobe, occipital lobe, and parietal lobe. When we listen to music, all four parts react. Though all of them work on different aspects, they all respond. When music enters our brain, it is split into pitch and volume. After that comes the feeling of emotions.</p>
        <p> The different effects music can have on your brain depend upon the genre we prefer to listen to.</p>
      
        <ul class="music-effect">
          <li>Soothing music like classical music helps us distress and has healing powers.</li>
          <li>Upbeat music releases endorphins which make us happy and increases our immune system.</li>
          <li>Pop music boosts energy and helps us exercise better.</li>
          <li>Rhythmic drumming helps in meditation.</li>
          <li>Metal is good for our sense of self and gives a strong sense of identity.</li>
          <li>Rap music can help fight against depression.</li>
          <li>Country music evokes feelings of internal joy.</li>
          <li>Classical music helps to manage stress.</li>
