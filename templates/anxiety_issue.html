    <h2>What is Anxiety?</h2>
    <p>Occasional anxiety is a normal part of life. Many people worry about things such as health, money, or family problems. But anxiety disorders involve more than temporary worry or fear. For people with an anxiety disorder, the anxiety does not go away and can get worse over time. The symptoms can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, schoolwork, and relationships.</p>
    <p>There are several types of anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and various phobia-related disorders.</p>
</section>

    <h2>Symptoms and Causes of Anxiety</h2>
    
    <p>Symptoms of anxiety disorders vary depending on the type.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Feeling panic, fear, dread, and uneasiness</li>
        <li>Feeling on edge or irritable</li>
        <li>Uncontrollable, obsessive thoughts</li>
        <li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
        <li>Restlessness</li>
        <li>Heart palpitations</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Muscle tension</li>
        <li>Cold or sweaty hands</li>
        <li>Dry mouth</li>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Numbness or tingling in your hands or feet</li>
        <li>Difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep (insomnia)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It’s important to talk to your healthcare provider or a mental health professional if you frequently experience these symptoms.</p>

    <h2>Types of Anxiety Disorders</h2>
    <p>An anxiety disorder is a type of mental health condition. If you have an anxiety disorder, you may respond to certain things and situations with fear and dread. You may also experience physical signs of anxiety, such as a pounding heart and sweating.

        It’s normal to have some anxiety. You may feel anxious or nervous if you have to tackle a problem at work, go to an interview, take a test or make an important decision. Some anxiety can even be beneficial — it helps us notice dangerous situations and focuses our attention so we stay safe.</p>
    <p>There are several types of anxiety disorders according to the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). This is the standard reference manual for diagnosing mental health conditions. Types of anxiety disorders include:</p>
    <p>But an anxiety disorder goes beyond the regular nervousness and slight fear you may feel from time to time. An anxiety disorder happens when:</p>
    <p>Anxiety interferes with your ability to function.</p>
    <p>Your reactions are often out of proportion to situations (overreactions).</p>
    <p>You can’t control your responses to situations.</p>

    <p>Children, adolescents and adults can experience anxiety disorders. Women and people assigned female at birth are about twice as likely as men and people assigned male at birth to have one.

        Anxiety disorders can make it difficult to get through the day. Fortunately, there are several effective treatments for these conditions.</p>

    <h3>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</h3>
    <p>GAD usually involves a persistent feeling of anxiety or dread, which can interfere with daily life. It is not the same as occasionally worrying about things or experiencing anxiety due to stressful life events. People living with GAD experience frequent anxiety for months, if not years.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Feeling restless, wound-up, or on-edge</li>
        <li>Being easily fatigued</li>
        <li>Having difficulty concentrating</li>
        <li>Being irritable</li>
        <li>Having headaches, muscle aches, stomachaches, or unexplained pains</li>
        <li>Difficulty controlling feelings of worry</li>
        <li>Having sleep problems, such as difficulty falling or staying asleep</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Panic Disorder</h3>
    <p>People with panic disorder have frequent and unexpected panic attacks, which are sudden periods of intense fear or discomfort. Not everyone who experiences a panic attack will develop panic disorder. Symptoms during a panic attack include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pounding or racing heart</li>
        <li>Sweating</li>
        <li>Trembling or tingling</li>
        <li>Chest pain</li>
        <li>Feelings of impending doom</li>
        <li>Feelings of being out of control</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Social Anxiety Disorder</h3>
    <p>Social anxiety disorder involves an intense, persistent fear of being watched and judged by others. It can interfere with everyday activities such as going to work or school. Symptoms include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Blushing, sweating, or trembling</li>
        <li>Pounding or racing heart</li>
        <li>Stomachaches</li>
        <li>Rigid body posture or speaking with an overly soft voice</li>
        <li>Difficulty making eye contact</li>
        <li>Fear of being judged negatively by others</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Phobia-related Disorders</h3>
    <p>Phobias involve an intense fear of specific objects or situations. Although anxiety can be normal in some situations, phobia-related anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger. Types include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Specific Phobias: Fear of specific objects or situations like flying, heights, animals, injections, etc.</li>
        <li>Agoraphobia: Fear of open or crowded places, being outside alone, using public transportation, etc.</li>
        <li>Separation Anxiety Disorder: Fear of being away from close individuals or loved ones.</li>
        <li>Selective Mutism: Difficulty speaking in certain social situations despite having normal language skills.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
    
    <h3>Psychotherapy</h3>
    <p>Psychotherapy or "talk therapy" can help people with anxiety disorders. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a common method that teaches different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to situations.</p>
    
    <h3>Medication</h3>
    <p>Medication does not cure anxiety but can help relieve symptoms. Medications like antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, and beta-blockers are commonly used to treat anxiety.</p>
    
    <h3>Support Groups & Stress Management</h3>
    <p>Support groups and stress management techniques like exercise, mindfulness, and meditation can help manage anxiety symptoms.</p>

    <h2>Risk Factors for Anxiety</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Shyness in childhood</li>
        <li>Exposure to stressful events</li>
        <li>A history of anxiety or mental disorders in relatives</li>
        <li>Thyroid problems or heart arrhythmia</li>
        <li>Substance use, such as caffeine or certain medications</li>
    </ul>
