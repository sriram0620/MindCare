    <p>Substance use disorder (SUD), formerly known as drug addiction, is a mental health condition where you experience a problematic pattern of substance use that affects your health and quality of life.</p>
    <p>Substances change how your brain functions over time. They release dopamine, a chemical in your brain that makes you feel good — until the substance wears off. Your brain and body want to continue this good feeling, even if it’s unhealthy. It can significantly impact your emotional well-being, relationships, education, and career. And in many cases, it’s life-threatening.</p>
    <p>SUD exists on a spectrum and may be mild, moderate, or severe. No matter where you are, know that this condition is treatable and help is available when you’re ready.</p>

    <h2>What are the Types of Substance Use Disorder?</h2>
    <p>Some of the most common types include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Alcohol use disorder.</li>
        <li>Cocaine use disorder.</li>
        <li>Cannabis use disorder.</li>
        <li>Tobacco use disorder.</li>
        <li>Methamphetamine use disorder.</li>
        <li>Opioid use disorder.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It’s common to have more than one SUD at a time, like alcohol use disorder and tobacco use disorder. This is known as a polysubstance use disorder.</p>

    <h2>What is the Most Common Type of Substance Use Disorder?</h2>
    <p>Alcohol use disorder is the most common type of SUD in the U.S.</p>

    <h2>Symptoms and Causes</h2>
    <h3>What are the Symptoms of Substance Use Disorder?</h3>
    <p>The symptoms and effects of substance use disorder vary based on the type of substance you use. There are two groups of symptoms based on when or if the substance is in your body. These include:</p>
    <h4>Intoxication</h4>
    <p>This is the immediate and short-term effect of a substance in your body. Symptoms include feeling sleepy, calm, excited, intense emotions, etc. The substance can also affect your judgment and decision-making or physical and mental functioning.</p>
    <h4>Withdrawal</h4>
    <p>These are symptoms that happen when the short-term effects of a substance wear off and the substance starts to leave your body. Symptoms are unpleasant and could include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, sweating, difficulty sleeping, muscle cramping, and mood changes.</p>

    <h3>What are the Signs of a Substance Use Disorder?</h3>
    <p>According to the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the signs of substance use disorder include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Taking the substance in larger amounts and for a longer amount of time than you’re meant to if it’s a prescription.</li>
        <li>Having a strong desire or urge to use the substance.</li>
        <li>Having unsuccessful efforts to cut down on or manage substance use.</li>
        <li>Spending a lot of time obtaining or using the substance or recovering from its effects.</li>
        <li>Having issues fulfilling responsibilities at work, school, or home due to substance use.</li>
        <li>Continuing to use the substance, even when it causes problems in relationships.</li>
        <li>Giving up social, occupational, or recreational activities because of substance use.</li>
        <li>Using substances again and again, even when it puts you in danger.</li>
        <li>Continuing substance use despite an ongoing physical or psychological problem that’s likely caused or worsened by the substance.</li>
        <li>Developing tolerance (need for increased amounts to get the same effect).</li>
        <li>Experiencing withdrawal symptoms, which can be relieved by taking more of the substance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Seeking medical care as soon as you have signs of substance use disorder is essential.</p>

    <h3>What Causes Substance Use Disorder?</h3>
    <p>The exact cause of a substance use disorder isn’t well understood. However, research shows that the changes to your brain’s reward system due to a substance’s addictive potential may cause the condition.</p>

    <h3>How Does a Substance Use Disorder Develop?</h3>
    <p>Studies found that many factors may be involved in the development of an SUD. These could include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Social pressure.</li>
        <li>Curiosity of substance effects.</li>
        <li>Performance enhancement (to do better at work or school).</li>
        <li>Emotional escape (like relief from stress, anxiety, fear, or depression).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The progression to a substance use disorder often follows this pattern:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Experimental use (or prescription use): Trying a substance once or using the substance as directed.</li>
        <li>Occasional use: Taking a substance socially or using prescriptions not as directed.</li>
        <li>Heavy use: Taking a substance routinely, with few to no days off of the substance.</li>
        <li>Substance use disorder: You take the substance daily or multiple times daily. There are rarely times when you’re not using a substance.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is just an example, as this condition looks very different and ranges in severity from person to person.</p>

    <h3>What are the Risk Factors for a Substance Use Disorder?</h3>
    <p>Substance use disorder affects people of all ages, races, sexes, genders, and socioeconomic levels.</p>
    <p>You may be more at risk of developing it if you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Have an underlying mental health condition.</li>
        <li>Have a biological relative with a SUD.</li>
        <li>Have a history of adverse childhood experiences.</li>
        <li>Have a genetic susceptibility (a genetic variant makes SUDs more common).</li>
        <li>Have exposure or easy access to substances.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What are the Complications of Substance Use Disorder?</h3>
    <p>One of the more common and most deadly complications of substance use disorder is overdose. An overdose happens when you take too much of a substance. This is a medical emergency.</p>
    <p>Different substances affect different parts of your body. For example, if you overdose on opioids, it targets the part of your brain that regulates your breathing. If not treated quickly, your breathing slows or stops completely, leading to death.</p>
    <p>SUD complications are extensive and vary based on severity and type. Common complications may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cancer.</li>
        <li>Depression.</li>
        <li>Infections (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV).</li>
        <li>Memory loss.</li>
        <li>Academic or career challenges.</li>
        <li>Interpersonal relationship difficulties.</li>
        <li>Unsafe, illegal, or at-risk behaviors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Diagnosis and Tests</h2>
    <h3>How is Substance Use Disorder Diagnosed?</h3>
    <p>There isn’t a single test available to diagnose substance use disorder. Instead, healthcare providers rely on a thorough evaluation of your medical history and behaviors surrounding substance use. They may order drug tests to see how much and how many types of substances are in your body at a time. They may also evaluate prescription drug monitoring program reports (a database of distributed controlled substances).</p>
    <p>A provider will also ask about your mental health history, as it’s common to have an SUD and a mental health condition.</p>
    <p>According to the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), a person must have at least two signs in the symptoms section over 12 months to be diagnosed with substance use disorder.</p>
    <p>It’s important to remember that this condition exists on a spectrum of severity:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Two to three signs indicate a mild substance use disorder.</li>
        <li>Four or five signs indicate a moderate substance use disorder.</li>
        <li>Six or more symptoms indicate a severe substance use disorder.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Management and Treatment</h2>
    <h3>How is Substance Use Disorder Treated?</h3>
    <p>The first step of substance use disorder treatment is withdrawal management. This is where you stop taking the substance, allowing it to leave your body. Depending on the severity, a healthcare provider may offer medications to lessen the effects of withdrawal symptoms, as they can be rough physically and mentally.</p>
    <p>After detox, you may continue a course of treatment with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Therapy.</li>
        <li>Medication.</li>
        <li>Support groups.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It’s essential to have regular follow-up care to help prevent relapse.</p>
    <p>Behavioral therapy is often the core component of a substance use disorder treatment program. It helps you understand the factors that contribute to your substance use and develop coping strategies to avoid relapse.</p>

    <h3>What Medications are Used to Treat Substance Use Disorder?</h3>
    <p>Several medications are approved to treat substance use disorder. The types of medications used depend on the specific substance use disorder. Some common medications include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Naltrexone (Vivitrol) for alcohol and opioid use disorders.</li>
        <li>Buprenorphine (Suboxone) for opioid use disorder.</li>
        <li>Disulfiram (Antabuse) for alcohol use disorder.</li>
        <li>Acamprosate (Campral) for alcohol use disorder.</li>
        <li>Methadone for opioid use disorder.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Medication may also be prescribed for underlying mental health conditions, which could be a contributing factor to substance use disorder.</p>

    <h3>What is the Outlook for People with Substance Use Disorder?</h3>
    <p>The outlook for people with substance use disorder varies based on factors such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How long you’ve had the condition.</li>
        <li>What substances you use.</li>
        <li>Your overall health and mental health history.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The earlier you seek treatment for substance use disorder, the better your chances for recovery. With proper treatment, people can regain control of their lives, improve their relationships, and build a healthier future.</p>

    <h2>How Can I Prevent Substance Use Disorder?</h2>
    <p>Taking steps to reduce your risk of developing a substance use disorder is important. This can include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Finding healthy coping mechanisms to deal with stress.</li>
        <li>Practicing mindfulness and meditation.</li>
        <li>Building a support system with friends, family, or professionals.</li>
        <li>Avoiding situations that may trigger substance use.</li>
        <li>Participating in treatment for underlying mental health conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you or someone you know is struggling with substance use disorder, it’s important to seek help. Recovery is possible, and support is available.</p>
