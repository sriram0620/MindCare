    <h2>What are Mood Disorders?</h2>
    <p>A mood disorder is a mental health condition that primarily affects your emotional state. It’s a disorder in which you experience long periods of extreme happiness, extreme sadness, or both. Mood disorders can cause changes in your behavior and affect your ability to perform routine activities.</p>
    <p>Examples of mood disorders include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Major depression</li>
        <li>Dysthymia (chronic, low-grade depression)</li>
        <li>Bipolar disorder</li>
        <li>Mood disorder related to another health condition</li>
        <li>Substance-induced mood disorder</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Types of Mood Disorders</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Depression:</strong> Feeling sad or hopeless for long periods, losing interest in activities once enjoyed, and difficulty thinking, memory, eating, and sleeping. The symptoms last at least two weeks for a diagnosis.</li>
        <li><strong>Bipolar disorder:</strong> Alternating periods of emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression).</li>
        <li><strong>Premenstrual dysphoric disorder:</strong> Severe mood changes related to hormonal fluctuations before menstruation.</li>
        <li><strong>Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder:</strong> A disorder in children and adolescents characterized by persistent irritability and frequent episodes of extreme behavioral outbursts.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Depression</h2>
    <p>Depression is more than just feeling sad for a few days. While sadness is a common symptom, depression is a serious mental health condition that requires diagnosis and often long-term treatment.</p>
    <h3>Subtypes of Depression:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Postpartum depression:</strong> Depression that occurs after giving birth, influenced by hormonal changes and stress.</li>
        <li><strong>Persistent depressive disorder:</strong> A long-term (chronic) form of depression that lasts for at least two years.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonal affective disorder (SAD):</strong> Depression associated with changes in seasons, usually during winter.</li>
        <li><strong>Depression with psychosis:</strong> Severe depression paired with psychotic symptoms like hallucinations or delusions.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Bipolar Disorder</h2>
    <p>Bipolar disorder causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). These episodes can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior, and the ability to think clearly.</p>
    <h3>Types of Bipolar Disorder:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bipolar I disorder:</strong> Defined by manic episodes that last at least 7 days or by manic symptoms so severe that immediate hospital care is needed, usually with depressive episodes lasting 2 weeks.</li>
        <li><strong>Bipolar II disorder:</strong> Characterized by a pattern of depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes, but not the full-blown manic episodes that are typical of Bipolar I disorder.</li>
        <li><strong>Cyclothymic disorder:</strong> Periods of hypomanic symptoms as well as periods of depressive symptoms lasting for at least 2 years (1 year in children and adolescents), but the symptoms do not meet the diagnostic requirements for a hypomanic episode and a depressive episode.</li>
        <li><strong>Other specified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders:</strong> Bipolar symptoms that do not match the three categories listed above but still involve periods of clinically significant abnormal mood elevation.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Other Mood Disorders</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD):</strong> A severe form of PMS with emotional and physical symptoms that interfere with daily life, occurring 7-10 days before menstruation.</li>
        <li><strong>Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD):</strong> A childhood condition of extreme irritability, anger, and frequent, intense temper outbursts.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Symptoms of Mood Disorders</h2>
    <h3>Depressive Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Feeling sad or hopeless most of the day</li>
        <li>Loss of interest in activities once enjoyed</li>
        <li>Significant weight loss or gain</li>
        <li>Insomnia or sleeping too much</li>
        <li>Fatigue or lack of energy</li>
        <li>Feelings of worthlessness or guilt</li>
        <li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
        <li>Thoughts of death or suicide</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Manic Symptoms:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Feeling overly happy or “high” for long periods of time</li>
        <li>Having a decreased need for sleep</li>
        <li>Talking very fast, often with racing thoughts</li>
        <li>Feeling overly irritable or restless</li>
        <li>Engaging in impulsive or risky behaviors</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>What Causes Mood Disorders?</h2>
    <p>Researchers believe several factors contribute to the development of mood disorders, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Biological factors:</strong> The brain areas responsible for controlling your feelings and emotions are the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. People with mood disorders have been shown to have an enlarged amygdala on brain imaging tests.</li>
        <li><strong>Genetic factors:</strong> People who have a strong family history of a mood disorder are more likely to develop mood disorders, which shows that mood disorders are likely partly genetic/inherited.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental factors:</strong> Stressful life changes, such as the death of a loved one; chronic stress; traumatic events; and childhood abuse are major risk factors for the development of a mood disorder later on in life, especially depression. Depression has also been linked to chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, Parkinson’s disease and heart disease.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Diagnosis and Tests</h2>
    <p>If you or your child are experiencing symptoms of a mood disorder, a healthcare provider may perform a physical examination to rule out physiological causes for symptoms, such as thyroid disease, other illnesses or a vitamin deficiency.</p>
    <p>Your provider will ask about your medical history, any medications you’re taking and whether you or any family members have been diagnosed with a mood disorder. They may refer you to a mental health professional.</p>
    <p>A mental health professional, such as a psychologist or psychiatrist, will conduct an interview or survey, asking questions about your symptoms, sleeping and eating habits and other behaviors. They use criteria in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to make diagnoses of mood disorders.</p>
    <p>In general, a mood disorder is diagnosed when sadness, elation, anger or other emotion is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Overly intense and persistent.</li>
        <li>Accompanied by other mood disorder symptoms, such as sleep changes or activity level changes.</li>
        <li>Significantly impairs the person’s capacity to function.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Management and Treatment</h2>
    <h3>How are Mood Disorders Treated?</h3>
    <p>Treatment for mood disorders depends on the specific condition and symptoms. Usually, treatment involves a combination of medication and psychotherapy (also called talk therapy). There are also other types of treatment, such as brain stimulation therapy.</p>

    <h3>Medications for Mood Disorders:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Antidepressants:</strong> SSRIs and SNRIs are commonly prescribed drugs to treat depression and bipolar disorder. Antidepressants take four to six weeks to work, and it’s important to take them as prescribed.</li>
        <li><strong>Mood stabilizers:</strong> Help regulate mood swings in bipolar disorder and other conditions. Lithium and anticonvulsants are commonly used.</li>
        <li><strong>Antipsychotics (neuroleptics):</strong> Used to treat mania in bipolar disorder. Atypical antipsychotics may be prescribed alongside antidepressants.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Psychotherapy for Mood Disorders:</h3>
    <p>Psychotherapy, or talk therapy, helps individuals identify and change unhealthy emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. Common types include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT):</strong> A goal-oriented treatment that focuses on changing negative thought patterns and behaviors.</li>
        <li><strong>Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT):</strong> Incorporates mindfulness and acceptance strategies to help manage intense emotions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Other Treatment Options:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT):</strong> Used when other treatments don’t work; electrical impulses are sent to the brain to treat severe depression or bipolar disorder.</li>
        <li><strong>Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS):</strong> Non-invasive brain stimulation therapy for depression.</li>
        <li><strong>Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS):</strong> A device implanted under the skin sends electrical signals to the vagus nerve to treat depression.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Prevention</h2>
    <h3>Can Mood Disorders Be Prevented?</h3>
    <p>There is no sure way to prevent mood disorders, but people who have a strong family history of a mood disorder or have had depression in the past can be more mindful of symptoms. Early treatment can reduce the severity of symptoms.</p>
