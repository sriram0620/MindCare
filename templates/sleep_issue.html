    <p>Sleep disorders are conditions that affect your ability to get the rest your body needs and maintain wakefulness. There are over 80 sleep disorders that impact:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How well you sleep (quality).</li>
        <li>When you fall asleep and if you can stay asleep (timing).</li>
        <li>How much sleep and wakefulness you get (quantity or duration).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Everyone can experience problems with sleep from time to time. But you might have a sleep disorder if:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You regularly have trouble sleeping.</li>
        <li>You feel tired during the day even though you slept for at least seven hours the night before.</li>
        <li>It becomes difficult to perform regular daytime activities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What are the Major Categories of Sleep Disorders?</h2>
    <p>The categories of sleep disorders have changed many times over the years. Most recently, the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) categorized sleep disorders based on the symptoms, how it affects a person (pathophysiology) and the body system it affects. The brand-new revision to the third edition, ICSD-3R includes the following categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Insomnia: You have difficulty falling and staying asleep.</li>
        <li>Sleep-related breathing disorders: Your breathing changes while you sleep.</li>
        <li>Central disorders of hypersomnolence: You have trouble feeling alert during the day.</li>
        <li>Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders: Your internal clock makes it difficult to fall asleep and wake up on time.</li>
        <li>Parasomnias: Physical actions or verbal expressions happen during sleep like walking, talking, or eating.</li>
        <li>Sleep-related movement disorders: Physical movements or the urge to move makes it difficult to fall asleep and/or stay asleep.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The ICSD updates regularly to include the most recent information about sleep disorders and the types that fall under these categories.</p>

    <h2>What are the Types of Sleep Disorders?</h2>
    <p>There are over 80 different types of sleep disorders. The most common include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Chronic insomnia: You have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep most nights for at least three months and feel tired or irritable as a result.</li>
        <li>Obstructive sleep apnea: You snore and have moments during sleep when you stop breathing that disrupt your sleep.</li>
        <li>Restless legs syndrome: You have the urge to move your legs when you rest.</li>
        <li>Narcolepsy: You can’t regulate when you fall asleep or how long you stay awake.</li>
        <li>Shift work sleep disorder: You have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep and feel sleepiness at unwanted times due to your work schedule.</li>
        <li>Delayed sleep phase syndrome: You fall asleep at least two hours after your desired bedtime and have difficulty waking up in time for school or work.</li>
        <li>REM sleep behavior disorder: You act out your dreams while in the rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Much Sleep Do I Need?</h2>
    <p>Everyone needs sleep. It’s an essential part of what makes our bodies function. The amount of sleep you need might be more or less than others, but experts recommend adults get seven to nine hours of sleep per night. Optimal sleep time varies by age; for example, children and teenagers may need more sleep than adults.</p>

    <h2>How Common Are Sleep Disorders?</h2>
    <p>More than 50 million people in the United States have a sleep disorder. In addition, more than 100 million Americans of all ages report that they don’t get an adequate amount of sleep.</p>

    <h2>Symptoms and Causes</h2>
    <h3>What are the Symptoms of Sleep Disorders?</h3>
    <p>Symptoms of common sleep disorders vary based on the type, but could include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Difficulty falling asleep or it takes more than 30 minutes to fall asleep regularly.</li>
        <li>Trouble staying asleep through the night or you wake up often in the middle of the night and can’t fall back asleep.</li>
        <li>Snoring, gasping or choking happens during sleep.</li>
        <li>Feeling like you need to move when you relax. Movement relieves this feeling.</li>
        <li>Feeling like you can’t move when you wake up.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>During the daytime, you may experience additional signs and symptoms caused by a lack of adequate sleep including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Daytime sleepiness; you take frequent daytime naps or fall asleep while doing routine tasks.</li>
        <li>Behavioral changes like difficulty focusing or paying attention.</li>
        <li>Mood changes like irritability and trouble managing your emotions.</li>
        <li>Difficulty meeting deadlines or performance expectations during school or work.</li>
        <li>Frequent accidents or falls.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you feel like you’re not able to get a good night’s rest or have symptoms that interfere with your daytime activities, talk to a healthcare provider.</p>

    <h3>What Causes Sleep Disorders?</h3>
    <p>A disruption to your body’s cycle of sleep and daytime wakefulness causes sleep disorders. Specific things may cause this to happen and it varies based on the type of sleep disorder you have. They may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A symptom of a medical condition like heart disease, asthma, pain or a nerve condition.</li>
        <li>A symptom of a mental health condition like depression or anxiety disorder.</li>
        <li>Genetic factors (a mutation).</li>
        <li>A side effect of a medication.</li>
        <li>Working the night shift.</li>
        <li>Substance use before bedtime like caffeine or alcohol.</li>
        <li>Low levels of certain chemicals or minerals in the brain.</li>
        <li>An unknown cause.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What are the Risk Factors for Sleep Disorders?</h3>
    <p>You may be more at risk of sleep disorders if you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Have an underlying health condition.</li>
        <li>Experience stress.</li>
        <li>Work late shifts.</li>
        <li>Have a history of sleep disorders in your biological family.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Research suggests that women and people assigned female at birth are more likely to experience sleep disorders than men and people assigned male at birth.</p>
    <p>In addition, about half of all adults over the age of 65 have a type of sleep disorder.</p>

    <h3>What Happens If I Don’t Get Enough Sleep?</h3>
    <p>If you don’t get the proper amount or quality of sleep that your body needs, it can affect you beyond feeling tired during the daytime. A lack of adequate sleep can lead to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Difficulty learning, remembering or making decisions.</li>
        <li>Personality changes like irritability.</li>
        <li>Lower reaction times (making accidents more likely to happen).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sleep loss can also contribute to the development of health conditions like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Depression.</li>
        <li>Obesity.</li>
        <li>Type 2 diabetes.</li>
        <li>Heart disease.</li>
        <li>Dementia.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While rare, some sleep disorders can be life-threatening.</p>

    <h2>Diagnosis and Tests</h2>
    <h3>How are Sleep Disorders Diagnosed?</h3>
    <p>A healthcare provider will diagnose a sleep disorder after a physical exam to review your symptoms and testing. Tests can help your healthcare provider learn more about what’s causing your symptoms like blood tests or imaging tests.</p>
    <p>They may ask you to keep a sleep diary. A sleep diary is a record of your sleeping habits. You’ll make note of when you go to bed, when you fall asleep and when you wake up each day. You should also make note of any naps you took during the daytime and how you felt before and after sleeping. It helps to keep a pen and piece of paper near your bed so you don’t forget to write these items down. It can be difficult to know what time you fall asleep exactly, so you should estimate what that time is. You might choose to wear a smartwatch or a device (actigraph) that records your cycles of rest and activity. This can confirm what time you fell asleep and woke up.</p>
    <p>Your primary care provider may recommend you visit a sleep specialist who’ll perform a sleep study (polysomnogram) if they suspect a sleep disorder. The sleep study tracks your brain waves, breathing, heart rate and blood oxygen levels while you sleep. It’s usually performed overnight at a sleep center. While the polysomnography is being done, you’ll wear sensors that monitor your sleep and movements. You’ll sleep in a room that simulates a home environment. There are often medical professionals on-site to monitor you during the study. You can ask questions or discuss any concerns with them during this time.</p>
    <p>After the sleep study is complete, the sleep specialist will analyze your results to help confirm a diagnosis and recommend treatment. For some sleep disorders, they may perform additional tests to confirm a diagnosis.</p>

    <h2>Treatment and Prevention</h2>
    <h3>What are the Treatments for Sleep Disorders?</h3>
    <p>The treatment for sleep disorders varies based on the type you have. It may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Behavioral therapy: This includes sleep hygiene education, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and relaxation techniques.</li>
        <li>Medications: Some sleep disorders can be treated with prescription medications or over-the-counter medications.</li>
        <li>Devices: A continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine can help you breathe while you sleep if you have obstructive sleep apnea.</li>
        <li>Other treatments: Melatonin or other supplements may help improve your sleep.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How Can I Prevent Sleep Disorders?</h3>
    <p>You can take steps to help prevent sleep disorders by establishing healthy sleep habits. Try to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, including weekends.</li>
        <li>Limit caffeine and alcohol use.</li>
        <li>Avoid nicotine, especially before bedtime.</li>
        <li>Exercise regularly.</li>
        <li>Establish a bedtime routine and keep your bedroom cool, quiet and dark.</li>
        <li>Try to limit naps to 30 minutes during the daytime.</li>
        <li>Avoid stimulating activities like using electronics within an hour of bedtime.</li>
    </ul>
