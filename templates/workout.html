        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This guide provides you with tips on how to look after your mental health using exercise.</p>
        <p>There are many reasons why physical activity is good for your body – having a healthy heart and improving your joints and bones are just two, but did you know that physical activity is also beneficial for your mental health and well-being?</p>
        <p>You can read the guide below, download it as a PDF or buy printed copies in our online shop.</p>
        <p>We need to change how we view physical activity in the UK to not see it as something we ‘have to do’, ‘should do’ or ‘ought to do’ for our health. But as something that we do because we value its positive benefits to our well-being.</p>
        <p>As part of our work to promote better mental health, we have produced a pocket guide to show the positive effect physical activity can have on your mental well-being, including some tips and suggestions to help you get started.</p>
        <p>Being active doesn’t just mean doing sports or going to the gym. There are many other ways to be active. Find the one that works for you, and let’s all get physical!</p>

        <h2>Why Should We Workout?</h2>
        <p>Working out offers numerous benefits, ranging from physical health to mental well-being. 
            Regular physical activity improves cardiovascular health, increases strength and flexibility, 
            enhances mood, and boosts overall longevity.</p>
        <p>Exercise also helps in maintaining a healthy 
            body weight, preventing chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, and 
            improving cognitive function.</p>
            <h4>Impact of Physical Activity on Well-being</h4>
            <p>Physical activity has a huge potential to enhance our well-being. Even a short burst of 10 minutes of brisk walking increases our mental alertness, energy, and positive mood.</p>
            <p>Regular physical activity can increase self-esteem, reduce stress and anxiety, and improve the quality of life for those experiencing mental health problems.</p>

        <h2>What is Physical Activity?</h2>
        <p>At a very basic level, physical activity means any movement of your body that uses your muscles and expends energy. One of the great things about physical activity is that there are endless possibilities and there will be an activity to suit almost everyone!</p>
        <p>It is recommended that the average adult should do between 75 and 150 minutes of exercise a week. This can be either moderate intensity exercise, such as walking, hiking or riding a bike, or it can be more vigorous activities, such as running, swimming fast, aerobics or skipping with a rope.</p>
        <p>The government defines well-being as ‘a positive physical, social and mental state’. For our purposes, we are focusing on mental well-being.</p>
        <p>Mental well-being encompasses factors such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The sense of feeling good about ourselves and being able to function well individually or in relationships</li>
            <li>The ability to deal with the ups and downs of life, such as coping with challenges and making the most of opportunities</li>
            <li>The feeling of connection to our community and surroundings</li>
            <li>Having control and freedom over our lives</li>
            <li>Having a sense of purpose and feeling valued</li>
        </ul>

                <h2>1. Cardiovascular (Aerobic) Workouts</h2>
                <p>
                    Cardiovascular or aerobic workouts increase heart rate, improve endurance, and help burn calories. They primarily involve sustained physical activity that raises your heart rate and breathing.
                </p>
            
                <h3>Benefits of Cardiovascular Workouts</h3>

                <h2>2. Strength Training (Anaerobic) Workouts</h2>
                <p>
                    Strength training or anaerobic exercises focus on building muscle strength, power, and endurance. These workouts involve short bursts of intense activity that push muscles to work harder than usual, typically without relying on oxygen for energy. This leads to muscle building, increased strength, and improved metabolic function.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Benefits of Strength Training (Anaerobic) Workouts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Increases Muscle Mass: Builds and tones muscles.</li>
                    <li>Boosts Metabolism: Increases resting metabolic rate, helping in fat loss.</li>
                    <li>Strengthens Bones: Enhances bone density and reduces the risk of osteoporosis.</li>
                    <li>Improves Posture: Strengthens muscles around joints, aiding in stability and balance.</li>
                    <li>Reduces Risk of Injury: Strengthens ligaments, tendons, and joints.</li>

           <h3>Conclusion</h3>
           <p>Literally thousands of studies have shown that the more you move, the lower your risks for heart disease, diabetes, obesity, multiple types of cancer, joint pain, and Alzheimer's disease. Exercise can also lift your mood, reduce your stress level, and improve your sleep.</p>


            <h2>Stretching Exercises</h2>
            <p>Stretching exercises are essential for improving flexibility, reducing muscle tension, and enhancing overall mobility. They can be incorporated into warm-ups, cool-downs, or standalone sessions. Stretching improves blood circulation, helps in muscle recovery, and reduces the risk of injury.</p>
            
            <h3>Benefits of Stretching Exercises</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased Flexibility: Enhances range of motion and flexibility in muscles and joints.</li>
                <li>Improved Circulation: Increases blood flow to muscles, aiding in recovery.</li>
                <li>Reduced Muscle Tension: Eases muscle stiffness and reduces soreness.</li>
                <li>Improved Posture: Lengthens tight muscles, promoting better posture.</li>
                <li>Stress Relief: Relaxing stretches help reduce physical and mental stress.</li>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>Stretching keeps the muscles flexible and healthy, and we need that flexibility to maintain a range of motion in the joints. Without it, the muscles shorten and become tight. Then, when you call on the muscles for activity, they are unable to extend all the way. That puts you at risk for joint pain, strains, and muscle damage.</p>
