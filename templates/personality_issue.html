    <h1>Personality Disorder</h1>
    <p class = "tagline">“The happiest people are those who think the most interesting thoughts.”</p>
</header>
<hr>
    <p>A personality disorder is a mental health condition that involves long-lasting, all-encompassing, disruptive patterns of thinking, behavior, mood, and relating to others. These patterns cause a person significant distress and/or impair their ability to function.</p>
    <p>There are 10 types of personality disorders, each with different characteristics and symptoms.</p>
    <p>Personality is vital to defining who we are as individuals. It involves a unique blend of traits — including attitudes, thoughts, and behaviors — as well as how we express these traits in our interactions with others and with the world around us.</p>
    <p>Personality disorders may cause distorted perceptions of reality, abnormal behaviors, and distress across various aspects of life, including work, relationships, and social functioning. Additionally, people with a personality disorder may not recognize their troubling behaviors or the negative effect they have on others.</p>

    <h2>What are the Types of Personality Disorders?</h2>
    <p>The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which is the standard reference publication for recognized mental illnesses, organizes the 10 types of personality disorders into three main clusters (categories). Each cluster has different symptoms in common.</p>

    <h3>Cluster A Personality Disorders</h3>
    <p>Cluster A personality disorders involve unusual and eccentric thinking or behaviors. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Paranoid personality disorder:</strong> The main feature of this condition is paranoia, which is a relentless mistrust and suspicion of others without adequate reason for suspicion. People with paranoid personality disorder often believe others are trying to demean, harm or threaten them.</li>
        <li><strong>Schizoid personality disorder:</strong> This condition is marked by a consistent pattern of detachment from and general disinterest in interpersonal relationships. People with schizoid personality disorder have a limited range of emotions when interacting with others.</li>
        <li><strong>Schizotypal personality disorder:</strong> People with this condition display a consistent pattern of intense discomfort with and limited need for close relationships. Relationships may be hindered by their distorted views of reality, superstitions, and unusual behaviors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cluster B Personality Disorders</h3>
    <p>Cluster B personality disorders involve dramatic and erratic behaviors. People with these types of conditions display intense, unstable emotions and impulsive behaviors. Cluster B personality disorders include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD):</strong> People with ASPD show a lack of respect toward others and don’t follow socially accepted norms or rules. People with ASPD may break the law or cause physical or emotional harm to others around them.</li>
        <li><strong>Borderline personality disorder (BPD):</strong> This condition is marked by difficulty with emotional regulation, resulting in low self-esteem, mood swings, impulsive behaviors, and subsequent relationship difficulties.</li>
        <li><strong>Histrionic personality disorder:</strong> This condition is marked by intense, unstable emotions and a distorted self-image. For people with histrionic personality disorder, their self-esteem depends on the approval of others and doesn’t come from a true feeling of self-worth.</li>
        <li><strong>Narcissistic personality disorder:</strong> This condition involves a consistent pattern of perceived superiority and grandiosity, an excessive need for praise and admiration, and a lack of empathy for others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cluster C Personality Disorders</h3>
    <p>Cluster C personality disorders involve severe anxiety and fear. They include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Avoidant personality disorder:</strong> People with this condition have chronic feelings of inadequacy and are highly sensitive to being negatively judged by others.</li>
        <li><strong>Dependent personality disorder:</strong> This condition is marked by a constant and excessive need to be cared for by someone else. It also involves submissiveness, a need for constant reassurance, and the inability to make decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD):</strong> This condition is marked by a consistent and extreme need for orderliness, perfectionism, and control (with no room for flexibility).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who Do Personality Disorders Affect?</h2>
    <p>Anyone can have a personality disorder. But different types of personality disorders affect people differently.</p>
    <p>Most personality disorders begin in the teen years when your personality further develops and matures. Almost all people diagnosed with personality disorders are above the age of 18, except for antisocial personality disorder, which often starts in childhood.</p>


    <h2>Diagnosis and Tests</h2>

    <h3>How Are Personality Disorders Diagnosed?</h3>
    <p>Personality disorders can be difficult to diagnose since most people with a personality disorder don’t think there’s a problem with their behavior. Healthcare providers base the diagnosis of a specific personality disorder on criteria provided in the DSM-5.</p>
    <p>Because of this, people with a personality disorder typically don’t seek help or a diagnosis for their condition. Instead, their loved ones or a social agency may refer them to a mental health professional because their behavior causes difficulty for others.</p>
    <p>When they do seek help, it’s often due to conditions such as anxiety, depression or substance use, or because of the problems created by their personality disorder, such as divorce or unemployment, not the disorder itself.</p>
    <p>Healthcare providers base the diagnosis of a specific personality disorder on criteria provided in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.</p>
    <p>When a mental health professional, like a psychologist or psychiatrist, suspects someone might have a personality disorder, they often ask broad, general questions that won’t create a defensive response or hostile environment. They ask questions that will shed light on:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Past history</li>
        <li>Relationships</li>
        <li>Previous work history</li>
        <li>Reality testing</li>
        <li>Impulse control</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Management and Treatment</h2>

    <h3>How Are Personality Disorders Treated?</h3>
    <p>Personality disorders are some of the most difficult disorders to treat in psychiatry. This is mainly because people with personality disorders don’t think their behavior is problematic, so they don’t often seek treatment.</p>
    <p>And even if a person with a personality disorder seeks treatment, modern medicine is still lacking in available treatment options — there are no medications currently approved to treat any personality disorder. But there are medications that can help with symptoms of anxiety and depression, which are common in people with a personality disorder.</p>
    <p>But psychotherapy (talk therapy) can help manage personality disorders. Psychotherapy is a term for a variety of treatment techniques that aim to help you identify and change troubling emotions, thoughts and behaviors. Working with a mental health professional, like a psychologist or psychiatrist, can provide support, education and guidance to you and your family.</p>
    <p>The main goals of psychotherapy for treating personality disorders include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reducing immediate distress, such as anxiety and depression.</li>
        <li>Helping the person understand that their problems are internal and not caused by other people or situations.</li>
        <li>Decreasing unhealthy and socially undesirable behavior.</li>
        <li>Modifying the personality traits that are causing difficulties.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are several different types of psychotherapy, and each personality disorder requires different types.</p>
    <p>For example, studies show that dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is effective for treating those with borderline personality disorder, and people with histrionic personality disorder often benefit from <a href = "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/21208-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt">cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).</a></p>

        <h2>Factors Influencing Personality Disorders</h2>

        <h3>1. Genetics:</h3>
        <p>Scientists have identified a malfunctioning gene that may be a factor in obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Researchers are also exploring genetic links to aggression, anxiety, and fear, which are traits that can play a role in personality disorders.</p>

        <h3>2. Brain Changes:</h3>
        <p>Researchers have found subtle brain differences in people with certain personality disorders:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Paranoid Personality Disorder:</strong> Altered amygdala functioning, which is involved with processing fearful and threatening stimuli.</li>
            <li><strong>Schizotypal Personality Disorder:</strong> A volumetric decrease in the frontal lobe of the brain.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Childhood Trauma:</h3>
        <p>One study revealed a link between childhood traumas and the development of personality disorders. For example, people with borderline personality disorder had especially high rates of childhood sexual trauma. Issues with intimacy and trust may be related to childhood abuse and trauma, particularly for those with borderline and antisocial personality disorders.</p>

        <h3>4. Verbal Abuse:</h3>
        <p>In one study, people who experienced verbal abuse as children were three times as likely to have borderline, narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, or paranoid personality disorders in adulthood.</p>

        <h3>5. Cultural Factors:</h3>
        <p>Cultural factors may also play a role in the development of personality disorders, as shown by the varying rates of these disorders between countries. For example, there are lower cases of antisocial personality disorders in Taiwan, China, and Japan, but higher rates of cluster C personality disorders.</p>

        <h2>Effects on Identity and Relationships</h2>

        <h3>1. Identity and a Sense of Self:</h3>
        <p>People with personality disorders generally lack a clear or stable image of themselves. Their self-esteem may be unrealistically high or low, and their self-perception may change depending on the situation or the people they are with.</p>

        <h3>2. Relationships:</h3>
        <p>Those with personality disorders struggle to form close, stable relationships due to problematic beliefs and behaviors. They may lack empathy, respect, or be emotionally detached, while others may be overly needy for attention and care.</p>

        <h3>3. Lack of Self-Awareness:</h3>
        <p>Most individuals with personality disorders often have little to no insight or self-awareness of how their thoughts and behaviors are problematic.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Identifying Personality Disorders</h2>

        <h3>How Do You Know if Someone Has a Personality Disorder?</h3>
        <p>You can’t know for sure if someone has a personality disorder unless they receive a professional diagnosis. It’s important to differentiate between personality types and disorders.</p>
        <p>For instance, being shy or introverted doesn’t necessarily mean someone has an avoidant or schizoid personality disorder. The impact of a person's personality on their work, relationships, emotions, self-identity, and behavior helps differentiate between personality traits and disorders.</p>

        <h3>General Signs of a Personality Disorder:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Behavior is inconsistent, frustrating, and confusing to others.</li>
            <li>Lack of understanding of realistic and acceptable ways to treat others.</li>
            <li>Unawareness of how their behaviors cause problems for themselves or others.</li>
            <li>Detached, overemotional, abusive, or irresponsible parenting styles, which can affect their children’s well-being.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <h2>Prevention</h2>

    <h3>Can Personality Disorders Be Prevented?</h3>
    <p>There is no known way to prevent personality disorders at this time, but seeking help early can decrease disruption in life, family, and friendships.</p>
