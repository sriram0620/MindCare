        <p>An eating disorder is a mental health condition that affects your relationship with food and how you see yourself (body image). Eating disorders affect your physical and emotional health and can be life-threatening.</p>
        <p>The symptoms of eating disorders look and feel different for each person and vary based on the type. You may count calories or limit how much and what types of foods you eat. You may eat large amounts of food, eat non-food items, or throw up after eating. Eating may make you feel guilty or shameful instead of satisfied.</p>
        <p>Food is a necessity to survive. Everyone has their own connection with food — your favorite things to eat (or avoid) are unique to you. It may be difficult to see when an eating disorder is present because you’ve grown accustomed to it.</p>
        <p>While you may feel trapped in a cycle of disordered eating, know that treatment is available to help you feel well again when you’re ready.</p>

        <h2>Types of eating disorders</h2>
        <p>There are several different types of eating disorders, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Anorexia nervosa:</strong> Restricting food and/or caloric intake (self-starvation), fear of gaining weight and a distorted self-image.</li>
            <li><strong>Bulimia nervosa:</strong> Eating large amounts of food in a short amount of time (binging) or believing that the food intake was large, followed by getting rid of the food (purging) by vomiting, using laxatives (medications that make you poop) or exercising excessively.</li>
            <li><strong>Binge eating disorder:</strong> Eating or thinking that there was a large amount of food intake in a short amount of time (binging) followed by feeling shame, regret, guilt or depression.</li>
            <li><strong>Pica:</strong> Compulsively swallowing non-food items (such as chalk, dirt and paint).</li>
            <li><strong>Rumination disorder:</strong> Undigested food returns to a person’s mouth after swallowing it. It’s then rechewed, re-swallowed or spit out.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID):</strong> Limiting the amount or type of food eaten for reasons unrelated to a distorted self-image or an attempt to lose weight.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It’s possible to have more than one type of eating disorder at the same time.</p>

        <h2>How common are eating disorders?</h2>
        <p>Eating disorders are common. Studies show that 28.8 million people in the United States will have an eating disorder in their lifetime.</p>

        <h2>Symptoms and Causes</h2>
        <h3>What are the signs and symptoms of eating disorders?</h3>
        <p>Signs and symptoms of eating disorders vary based on the type but could include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mood swings.</li>
            <li>Fatigue.</li>
            <li>Fainting or dizziness.</li>
            <li>Thinning hair or hair loss.</li>
            <li>Unexplained weight changes or drastic weight loss.</li>
            <li>Unusual sweating or hot flashes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Behavioral symptoms of eating disorders may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Restrictive eating.</li>
            <li>Eating a lot in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>Avoiding food or certain foods.</li>
            <li>Forced vomiting after meals or laxative misuse.</li>
            <li>Compulsive exercising after meals.</li>
            <li>Frequent bathroom breaks after eating.</li>
            <li>Withdrawing from friends or social activities.</li>
            <li>Hiding food or throwing it away.</li>
            <li>Food rituals (chewing food longer than necessary, eating in secret).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It may be difficult to spot an eating disorder in a loved one, as it often mimics dietary or lifestyle changes (adjustments to the things you do to change your overall health). You also can’t tell by looking at someone to know if they have this condition.</p>

        <h3>What does an eating disorder feel like?</h3>
        <p>If you have an eating disorder, you may feel that:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Food is an enemy or it can harm you.</li>
            <li>You did something wrong or shameful after eating food.</li>
            <li>You aren’t at the correct weight or body size.</li>
            <li>You’re “failing” if you don’t meet certain weight or food requirements.</li>
            <li>Other people negatively perceive you.</li>
            <li>What and how you eat is the only thing in your life that you can control.</li>
            <li>You don’t want to spend time with others for fear of judgment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These feelings aren’t a voluntary choice. Beyond physical health, an eating disorder severely impacts your ability to make decisions, your emotions and your ability to interact with others as expected.</p>

        <h3>What causes eating disorders?</h3>
        <p>The exact cause of eating disorders is unknown. But research suggests there are several possible factors that lead to eating disorders, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Studies found that anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder run in families. You can inherit genetic traits from your biological family that make you more likely to develop the condition.</li>
            <li><strong>Brain biology:</strong> Dopamine and serotonin are chemicals in your brain. They make you feel things like pleasure and happiness. Research suggests that these chemicals activate during certain eating disorder behaviors.</li>
            <li><strong>Cultural and social ideals:</strong> Pressure to “fit in” can affect your mental health and change your patterns of behavior to meet certain, often unrealistic, goals set by others. In the digital era, social media, television and movies may also influence your self-esteem if you feel you don’t look like the people you follow or admire.</li>
            <li><strong>Underlying mental health conditions:</strong> You may use extreme measures around food when you feel like other aspects of your life are hard to manage. An obsession with food becomes an unhealthy way of coping with painful emotions or feelings. As a result, some eating disorders happen alongside other mental health conditions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What are the risk factors for eating disorders?</h2>
        <p>Anyone at any age can develop an eating disorder. They’re most common among adolescents and teenagers. You may be more at risk if you:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Have a history of eating disorders or other mental health conditions in your biological family.</li>
            <li>Experienced trauma (physical, emotional or sexual).</li>
            <li>Have an underlying mental health condition like anxiety, depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder.</li>
            <li>Participate in activities where your weight or body size is a factor (like gymnastics, wrestling or swimming).</li>
            <li>Go through a major change like starting a new school or job, a divorce or a move.</li>
            <li>Have Type 1 diabetes. Studies found that up to 25% of women and people assigned female at birth with Type 1 diabetes develop an eating disorder.</li>
            <li>Have a driven personality and strive for perfection (perfectionism).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What are the complications of eating disorders?</h2>
        <p>Greatly restricting calories, vomiting (throwing up) or extreme exercise can take a toll on your physical health. An untreated eating disorder causes serious complications such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Arrhythmia, heart failure and other heart problems.</li>
            <li>Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD).</li>
            <li>Gastrointestinal problems.</li>
            <li>Low blood pressure (hypotension).</li>
            <li>Organ failure and brain damage.</li>
            <li>Osteoporosis.</li>
            <li>Severe dehydration and constipation.</li>
            <li>Stopped menstrual cycles (amenorrhea) and infertility.</li>
            <li>Stroke.</li>
            <li>Tooth damage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a mental health condition, your feelings about food or your body image may put you at risk of suicide or thoughts of suicide. If at any time you feel overwhelmed or need someone to talk to, call or text 988 to reach the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (U.S.). Someone is available to help you 24/7.</p>

        <h2>Diagnosis and Tests</h2>
        <h3>How are eating disorders diagnosed?</h3>
        <p>There isn’t a single test to diagnose an eating disorder. Your healthcare provider may:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Conduct a physical exam.</li>
            <li>Review your medical history and symptoms.</li>
            <li>Ask about your eating habits, feelings about food and attitudes toward your body.</li>
            <li>Use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as a guide for diagnosing your eating disorder.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your healthcare provider may also ask you to undergo lab tests to measure your body’s health and nutritional levels.</p>

        <h2>Treatment and Management</h2>
        <h3>What are the treatments for eating disorders?</h3>
        <p>Eating disorders are treatable. But recovery takes time, patience and often a combination of treatment approaches, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Psychotherapy (talk therapy): Working with a mental health professional helps you explore and change thoughts and feelings about food, body image and coping with emotional pain.</li>
            <li>Medication: Antidepressants or other medications may be used to help treat underlying mental health conditions.</li>
            <li>Nutritional counseling: Working with a dietitian helps you develop a healthy relationship with food and a balanced eating plan.</li>
            <li>Support groups: Connecting with others who understand your struggles provides emotional support and a sense of community.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most people need treatment from a team of providers, including a therapist, dietitian and primary care provider.</p>

        <h3>What is the recovery time for eating disorders?</h3>
        <p>Everyone’s journey to recovery looks different. You may see improvement after a few weeks of treatment. For others, recovery can take months or years. The earlier you seek help, the better your chance of recovery.</p>
        <p>If you or a loved one has an eating disorder, don’t hesitate to reach out for help.</p>
