    <h2>What is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder?</h2>
    <p>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition characterized by persistent, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions). These obsessions and compulsions can significantly impact daily life and functioning.</p>
    <p>People with OCD often feel compelled to perform certain rituals or routines to alleviate the anxiety caused by their obsessions, but these compulsions provide only temporary relief.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Symptoms of OCD</h2>
    <h3>Common Obsessions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fear of contamination or dirt</li>
        <li>Fear of harming oneself or others</li>
        <li>Fear of making a mistake or being responsible for something terrible</li>
        <li>Need for order or symmetry</li>
        <li>Intrusive thoughts about taboo subjects</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Common Compulsions:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Excessive cleaning or handwashing</li>
        <li>Checking locks, appliances, or other items repeatedly</li>
        <li>Counting, tapping, or repeating actions a specific number of times</li>
        <li>Arranging items in a particular order</li>
        <li>Avoiding certain situations that trigger obsessions</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Causes of OCD</h2>
    <p>The exact cause of OCD is not fully understood, but several factors may contribute to its development, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Biological factors:</strong> Differences in brain structure and function may play a role in OCD.</li>
        <li><strong>Genetic factors:</strong> OCD tends to run in families, suggesting a genetic component.</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental factors:</strong> Stressful life events, trauma, and infections may trigger OCD in individuals who are predisposed to the disorder.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Diagnosis of OCD</h2>
    <p>Diagnosing OCD involves a comprehensive assessment by a mental health professional. They will evaluate the presence and severity of obsessions and compulsions, as well as their impact on daily functioning. The diagnosis may involve:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A thorough medical history</li>
        <li>A psychological evaluation</li>
        <li>Diagnostic criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Treatment for OCD</h2>
    <h3>Psychotherapy:</h3>
    <p>There are several types of psychotherapy. The most common and effective forms for treating OCD include:</p>
    <h4>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):</h4>
    <p>During CBT, a therapist will help you examine and understand your thoughts and emotions. Over several sessions, CBT can help alter harmful thoughts and stop negative habits, perhaps replacing them with healthier ways to cope.</p>
    <h4>Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP):</h4>
    <p>ERP is a type of CBT. During ERP, a therapist exposes you to your feared situations or images and has you resist the urge to perform a compulsion. For example, your therapist may ask you to touch dirty objects but then stop you from washing your hands. By staying in a feared situation without anything negative happening, you learn that your anxious thoughts are just thoughts and not necessarily reality.</p>
    <h4>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):</h4>
    <p>ACT helps you learn to accept obsessive thoughts as just thoughts, taking the power away from them. An ACT therapist will help you learn to live a meaningful life despite your OCD symptoms.</p>
    <p>Mindfulness techniques such as meditation and relaxation can also help with symptoms.</p>

    <h3>Medication:</h3>
    <p>Medications called serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), selective SRIs (SSRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants may help treat OCD.</p>
    <p>Healthcare providers most often recommend SSRIs for OCD and prescribe them at much higher doses than they do for anxiety or depression. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved SSRIs include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fluoxetine</li>
        <li>Fluvoxamine</li>
        <li>Paroxetine</li>
        <li>Sertraline</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It may take up to eight to 12 weeks for these medications to start working.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Prevention</h2>
    <p><strong>Can I prevent OCD?</strong> You can’t prevent OCD. But early diagnosis and treatment can help reduce its symptoms and its effects on your life.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Outlook / Prognosis</h2>
    <p><strong>What is the prognosis of OCD?</strong> The prognosis (outlook) of OCD can vary. OCD is often a lifelong condition that can wax and wane.</p>
    <p>People with OCD who receive appropriate treatment often experience increased quality of life and improved social, school, and/or work functioning.</p>
    <p>If you don’t receive treatment, the cycle of obsessions and compulsions is more difficult to break and treat, as structural changes in your brain take place. Because of this, it’s key to seek medical care as soon as possible if you or your child experience symptoms.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Living With OCD</h2>
    <p><strong>How do I take care of myself if I have OCD?</strong> Aside from seeking medical treatment for OCD, practicing self-care can help manage your symptoms. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Getting quality sleep</li>
        <li>Exercising regularly</li>
        <li>Eating a healthy diet</li>
        <li>Spending time with loved ones who support you and understand OCD</li>
        <li>Practicing relaxation techniques, such as meditation, yoga, massage, and visualization</li>
        <li>Joining an in-person or online support group for people who have OCD</li>
    </ul>
